BASIC STAGING AND COMMITS
1) Don't try git add on root folder; just do it for individual files as there maybe project files to ignore
2) Can do git add on ./folder to get all files in subdirectories and files in folder
note that add only applies to a FILE that exists, and doesn't need to be called for folders
3) Don't remove a tracked file via the editor; do it with the git command to remove file

BASIC BRANCHING
1) Always switch to the master branch before creating a new branch; to keep parallel work independent
2) Git rewrites your working directory to look like it did when you made the most recent commit on the
branch you just switched to.  So after switching branches; refresh or reopen the project in your editor
to view the correct branch snapshot of files and directories!
3) Always switch to the master branch before merging a feature branch into this integration branch
4) Always switch to master branch before deleting a merged branch
5) you can always recover a deleted branch with the commit ID displayed on delete:
git branch <branch_name> <base_commit_ID>
