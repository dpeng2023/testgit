BASIC STAGING AND COMMITS
1) Don't try git add on root folder; just do it for individual files as there maybe project files to ignore
2) Can do git add on ./folder to get all files in subdirectories and files in folder
note that add only applies to a FILE that exists, and doesn't need to be called for folders
3) Don't remove a tracked file via the editor; do it with the git command to remove file

BASIC BRANCHING
1) Always switch to the master branch before create a new branch; to keep parallel work independent
