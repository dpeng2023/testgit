DIFF operations (only on TRACKED, or already-added files)
1) git diff
to compare ---index +++working directory
2) git diff --staged
to compare ---committed +++index
3) git diff int_branch1 feat_branch2
to compares the 'tip' commit on each branch
---integration +++feature
4) git diff <older commit ID1> <latest commit ID2>
where IDs come from ID log of branch:
git log --oneline --all --graph
IDs don't have to be parent and child; or even on the same branch
HEAD tells you the latest commit for the branch you're on
eg git diff HEAD~1 HEAD  pror commit with latest commit
