WORKING with REMOTES

1) Clone repo from GitHub
- Login to GitHub
- goto repo to Fork to my account
https://github.com/looselytyped/working-with-remotes
- goto my account Fork
https://github.com/dpeng2023/working-with-remotes
Choose CODE, HTTPS, then copy the URL
https://github.com/dpeng2023/working-with-remotes.git
- create local folder to house repo
~/github/headfirst-git/ch05
- do
git clone https://github.com/dpeng2023/working-with-remotes.git <optional-renamed-project-folder>
*** FORK NOT NEEDED IF GIVEN PERMISSIONS TO COLLABORATE, then direct cloning OK

2) Personal Access Token generated and saved under
~/github/token.txt

3) git config --global push.default simple

4) git push
- enter GitHub Username
- enter Personal Access Token

5) goto remote GitHub website from (1) to verify files pushed to remote

6) DEFAULT is git push origin
git remote -v shows URL where remote origin lives

7) create a new branch, commit changes on it, then push it to remote where branch did not exist
git push -u origin feat-a

**** On SOLO projects, do merge to master locally, then push master to remote
with git checkout master
     git remote -v
     git fetch
     git merge origin/master

=> (SOLO ONLY) do git push origin master
now if working on master solo and no branches

**** On JOINT projects, push up branch to remote and submit a pull-merge request
=> (do above to update local master from remote, then merge master to feature branch)
git checkout feature-branch
git merge master
git push -u origin feature-branch
or just git push if git branch -vv -a shows remote tracking exists

=> goto (8) below

8) On GitHub for your remote repo:  goto pull request tab; hit button for new pull request
- choose master branch for the base or target branch to merge into (one with your GitHub username)
- choose feature branch for the source branch you want to merge from
- hit button for create new pull request  (this is a REMOTE MERGE REQUEST)

9) In Pull Request created; View Commits, add Review Comments

10) In Pull Request, hit button to Merge pull request

11) Hit button to delete feat-a branch at confirmation

12) Now we need to update our LOCAL repo with the REMOTE merge and branch deletion!
- git checkout master
- git branch -a -vv
- git fetch -p
prunes local branches per remote
- git branch -a -vv
-> git branch -D <local branch>
to force delete without merging branch to master
-> git checkout master
   git merge origin/master
to download updates from remote origin master to local master
(this is NOT the same a PULL REQUEST, as it applies to LOCAL master)

13) *** DIFF before merge

git diff master/feature origin/master
         --a            ++b
         merge target   source

git diff
     index  working dir
     --a    --b

git diff --cached
      object DB     index
      --a           --b
